# 16-bit ALU in Logisim  

## 🖥️ Overview  
This project is a **16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** implemented in **Logisim**, based on the design principles from the book *The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris)*. The ALU is a crucial component of a CPU, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

- Supports **multiplexed control inputs** to select operations  
- Zero and negative flag outputs for condition checking  
- Designed using **basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, Multiplexers, Adders)**  

## 🛠️ Built With  
- **Logisim** – A digital circuit design and simulation software  
- **Boolean Algebra & Digital Logic** concepts from *The Elements of Computing Systems*
